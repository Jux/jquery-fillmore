h1. jQuery Fillmore

Fillmore is a jQuery plugin that allows you to add a dynamically-resized background image to any page, or any given element.
The image will stretch to fit the page / element, and will automatically resize as the window size changes.

This was originally a fork of the jquery Backstretch plugin, which only allowed for stretching an image as the background 
of the page body, but then was rewritten to allow stretching a background image over any desired element as well. Hence the name,
"Fillmore"; it fills more elements :)  It still maintains the same method parameters as backstretch, and can therefore 
replace backstretch in your code if you want to start taking advantage of being able to stretch an image over any given element 
as well (as long as you change the name 'backstretch' to 'fillmore'). 

The original jquery Backstretch plugin is here: https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch.  Thanks Scott Robbin.


h2. Demo

There are a couple of examples included with this package, or feel free to check it out live "on the project page itself.":http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-fillmore/


h2. Setup

Include the jQuery library and Fillmore plugin files in your webpage (preferably at the bottom of the page, before the closing BODY tag):

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.fillmore.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

Note: The example above uses the Google hosted version of jQuery; there is also a jQuery source file included with this distribution, if you would like to host it yourself.


h2. Usage

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  // To stretch an image over the document body
  $.fillmore( String imgSrc, [Object options], [Function callback] );

  // The above is equivalent to:
  $('body').fillmore( String imgSrc, [Object options], [Function callback] );


  // To stretch an image over any element(s) (jQuery wrapped set)
  $('div.myEls').fillmore( String imgSrc, [Object options], [Function callback] );
</script>
</code></pre>

The callback is executed when a new image has been loaded and faded in.


h2. Options

h3. centeredX

The ratio of the width/height of the image doesn't always jive with the width/height of the window. This parameter controls whether or not we center the image on the X axis to account for the discrepancy. (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. centeredY

This parameter controls whether or not we center the image on the Y axis to account for the aforementioned discrepancy. (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. speed

This is the speed at which the image will fade in, after downloading is complete. Integers are accepted, as well as standard jQuery speed strings (slow, normal, fast). (type=Integer, default=0)



h2. Examples

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  // Add a stretched background image to the page (body)
  $.fillmore("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
</script>
</code></pre>

Want to change the background image after Fillmore has been loaded? No problem, just call it again!

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $.fillmore("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
  
  // Perhaps you'd like to change the image on a button click
  $(".button").click(function() {
      $.fillmore("/path/to/next_image.jpg");
  });
</script>
</code></pre>


You may also stretch a background image over any element(s) as well.

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $('div').fillmore("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
  
  // And then changing them at a later time...
  $(".button").click(function() {
      $('div').fillmore("/path/to/next_image.jpg");
  });
</script>
</code></pre>
